Mining
================================================================================

Mining is the process of validating and adding blocks to the blockchain.
Computers that perform this service are referred to as *miners* along with the
people administering those computers.

Proof Of Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information necessary to add blocks to the blockchain is referred to as
proof of work information.  It is intentionally made difficult to create.  This
difficulty is one reason for the security of the blockchain.  The mining contest
undertaken by miners to find the proof of work information for the next block is
also a process by which everyone is made to agree on the official ordering of
the blocks in the blockchain.  For this reason, the mining process involving
proof of work is also referred to as the consensus algorithm.

In order to incrase the security of the blockchain, recent blocks that did not
win the mining contest are also mentioned in the blockchain.
