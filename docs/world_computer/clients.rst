Clients
================================================================================

To interact with the ETC world computer requires communicating with a computer
on the ETC network.  It is relatively easy to set up a computer to become part
of the network.  This requires the installation of an implementation of the ETC
communication protocols.  Possible choices include
`Geth <https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum>`_,
`Parity <https://github.com/paritytech/parity>`_
and `Mantis <https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis>`_.
To use ETC, it is not necessary to set up a new computer on the
network. Applications can simply request information from other network
computers.  Such applications are referred to as *light clients*.  Whether using
a light client or setting up a full network computer, users can communicate with
the ETC network using Web 3.
